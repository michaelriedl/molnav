# MolNav
MolNav (Molecular Navigator): Navigating the future of molecular modeling.

This repository implements a number of state-of-the-art deep learning models for molecular modeling using PyTorch.

## Getting Started
To get started with MolNav, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/michaelriedl/molnav.git
```

2. Install the package:
```bash
uv sync --all-extras
```

Note: MolNav is not yet available on PyPI, so you need to install it from source.
